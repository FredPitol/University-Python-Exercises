# University Python Exercises

This repository houses Python exercises that I completed during my academic tenure, as part of various programming courses, encompassing an array of topics. 

The exercises are systematically organized by course, are enveloped within their designated folder, which in turn comprises a subfolder assigned to each of the exercises. Within each of the exercise subfolders, a comprehensive README file is encased

## Prerequisites

Have Python 3 pre-installed on the system . However, few exercises may entail an additional suite of libraries, which would be mentioned in the corresponding README files.

## Usage

Clone the repository onto your local machine using the following command:

```
https://github.com/FredPitol/University-Python-Exercises.git
```

Once cloned, travel through the folders to identify the specific course and exercise and run the Python file within the designated folder.

## Contributions

If you encounter any complexities, or you have suggestion of these exercises, don't hesitate to create a pull request or submit an issue in the repository. As a believer in collaborative learning, I welcome contributions from the community.
